// src/features/imageProcessing/ControlPanelLogic.js

/**
 * This file is currently a placeholder.
 *
 * In the current application architecture, the logic and state management
 * for the control panel functionalities (drawing modes, color selection,
 * AI processing triggers, etc.) are primarily handled within `App.js`
 * and passed as props to the `AppLayout.js` component.
 *
 * Therefore, this `ControlPanelLogic.js` file does not contain active
 * React components, hooks, or a centralized logic flow for the UI controls.
 *
 * It can be used in the future to export general utility functions that are
 * pure (do not manage React state or side effects) and can be shared across
 * different parts of the application if needed.

// Example of a non-React utility function that could reside here:
export const formatColorString = (r, g, b, a = 1) => {
    return `rgba(${r}, ${g}, ${b}, ${a})`;
};

// You can add other pure utility functions here as your project evolves.
// For instance:
// export const validateImageFile = (file) => {
//     // Logic to validate file type, size, etc.
//     return file.type.startsWith('image/') && file.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024; // Example: images under 5MB
// };

// If this file is determined to have no future utility purpose,
// it can be safely deleted from the project.
